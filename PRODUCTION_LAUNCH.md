## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: 500 Errors on Auth Routes

**Symptoms:**
- `/api/auth/session` returns HTML instead of JSON
- LOGIN_ERROR or CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR in browser console

**Root Causes:**
- Missing NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- Incorrect NEXTAUTH_URL
- Database connection issue

**Resolution:**
1. Check Vercel environment variables are set
2. Verify DATABASE_URL connectivity
3. Check function logs for specific error
4. See [NEXTAUTH_PRODUCTION_CONFIG.md](./NEXTAUTH_PRODUCTION_CONFIG.md)

### Issue: Payment Processing Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Checkout completes but payment not processed
- Stripe webhook errors in logs

**Root Causes:**
- Incorrect webhook secret
- Webhook endpoint not reachable
- Using test keys instead of live keys

**Resolution:**
1. Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Stripe dashboard
2. Test webhook endpoint: `https://www.josemadrid.net/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Confirm using live keys (pk_live_, sk_live_)
4. Check Stripe dashboard webhook delivery logs

### Issue: Emails Not Sending

**Symptoms:**
- Order confirmation emails not received
- No errors in application logs

**Root Causes:**
- Resend API key incorrect
- Domain not verified
- DNS records not propagated
- Rate limits exceeded

**Resolution:**
1. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is production key
2. Check domain verification in Resend dashboard
3. Verify DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
4. Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs
5. See [EMAIL_SYSTEM.md](./EMAIL_SYSTEM.md)

### Issue: High Response Times

**Symptoms:**
- Slow page loads
- Function timeout errors
- Poor user experience

**Root Causes:**
- Database query performance
- N+1 query problems
- Large payload sizes
- Unoptimized images

**Resolution:**
1. Check database query performance
2. Review function execution logs
3. Analyze bundle size
4. Enable Next.js analytics to identify bottlenecks
5. See [PERFORMANCE.md](./PERFORMANCE.md)

### Issue: Google Maps Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Map component shows error
- "This page can't load Google Maps correctly"

**Root Causes:**
- API key not configured
- Billing not enabled
- API restrictions blocking domain
- Quota exceeded

**Resolution:**
1. Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY is set
2. Check billing in Google Cloud Console
3. Review API key restrictions (allow www.josemadrid.net)
4. Check quota usage and limits
5. See [GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md](./GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md)

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Roll Back

Roll back immediately if:
- Critical functionality broken (checkout, payments)
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Data corruption occurring
- Error rate exceeds 5%
- Site completely unavailable

### Rollback Steps

1. **Identify Previous Stable Version**
   ```bash
   # List recent deployments
   vercel list
   
   # Or check git tags
   git tag -l
   ```

2. **Rollback via Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Find last stable deployment
   - Click "..." → "Promote to Production"

3. **Or Rollback via CLI**
   ```bash
   # Deploy specific commit
   vercel --prod --yes --force --target production
   ```

4. **Verify Rollback**
   - [ ] Site loads successfully
   - [ ] Critical paths working
   - [ ] Error rate normalized

5. **Database Rollback (if needed)**
   - Restore from backup taken before deployment
   - Run migration rollback if safe:
     ```bash
     # Review migration before running
     npx prisma migrate diff --from-migrations
     ```
   - **Warning:** Database rollbacks can cause data loss. Only do if absolutely necessary.

6. **Post-Rollback**
   - Document incident
   - Identify root cause
   - Create hotfix plan
   - Communicate status to stakeholders
